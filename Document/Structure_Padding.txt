- 	In order to align the data in memory,  
	one or more empty bytes (addresses) are inserted (or left empty) 
	between memory addresses which are allocated for other structure members 
	while memory allocation. This concept is called structure padding
-	1 word = 4  bytes in 32bit procesor // reads 4bytes at a time
-	1 word = 8 	bytes in 64bit procesor	// reads 8bytes at a time
Example:
struct student1
{
   int id1; // 4bytes
   int id2;	// 4bytes
   char a;	// 1bytes
   char b;	// 4bytes
   float percentage;  // 4bytes
};

struct student
{
   int id1;	// 4bytes
   char a;	// 4bytes
   int id2;	// 4bytes
   char b;	// 4bytes
   float percentage;  // 4bytes
};

-	#pragma pack ( 1 ) directive can be used for arranging memory for 
	structure members very next to the end of other structure members.
